ChangeLog
---------

Release 3.0.1:
 - Fixed bug where "Integer array too small" array reported when restarting
   a story (Issue #21).
 - Removed leftover debugging code that would echo the transcript filename
 - Minor performance improvement by using LGetByte() instead of Peek()
   to read Z-machine memory.

Release 3:
 - Optimised the CMM2 implementation at '/zmim/zmim.bas'; this is approximately
   15% faster than Release 2.
   - The unoptimised version, with readable source-code can still be found
     at '/zmim/src/main.bas' this is now slower than Release 2 because it
     uses an error checking memory implementation.
 - Added CMM1 implementation at '/zmim/zmim_cm1.bas'
   - currently, and probably forever, this is too slow to be playable but is
     included for completeness as the CMM1 was the original target for this
     project.
 - Fixed bug that could cause a story to be omitted in the story file chooser.
   - also ignore all story files beginning with full-stop, they are an artefact
     created by macOS.
 - Fixed missing variable declaration in interactive debugger.
 - Minor updates to the README.

Release 2:
 - Added word-wrapping
   - assumes 100 character wide console.
 - Added paging, i.e. displays [MORE] prompt when more than one page of text is
   output between input prompts
   - assumes 50 character high console.
 - Made execution approximately 15% faster.
 - Changed startup so that console is now cleared before the story file starts
   executing.
 - Changed console so that it only ever scrolls upwards and the input prompt is
   always at the bottom
   - this is the conventional behaviour for the console of a Z-machine
     implementation.
   - EXCEPTION: the initial selection of a story file and choosing whether to
     write a script.
 - Changed console so that it recognises when a story is trying to clear the
   console and reponds appropriately
   - the Z-machine provides no specific clear console instruction instruction
     so old z3 stories often just print 20-40 blank lines on the assumption that
     will be sufficient; as it probably was for a 1980s microcomputer.
 - Fixed issue with Z-MIM changing the current working directory
   - Z-MIM still changes it during operation but should now restore it before
     exiting either cleanly or due to an error or Ctrl-C.
 - Fixed "Error: EXEC is not declared" when quitting after a 'restart'.
 - Minor improvements to the interactive debugger.
 - Cosmetic improvements to code and README.

Release 1:
 - Initial public beta.
